This is a six part series, taking you through stages of designing and creating reusable visualizations with d3.js

All visualizations have the same functionality, showcase the individual points with a bar chart and sum up the selected bars.

* [Basic Concept (vanilla d3.js)](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5518052)
* [Reusability Step](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5519642)
* [Angular.js + d3.js](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5519819)
* [ember.js + d3.js](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5520449)
* [Backbone.js + d3.js](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5522467)
* [react.js (& flux concepts) + d3.js](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/d22bbf92231876505e5d) <- New

Part 3. This is showcasing the power of combining Angular.js with d3.js and how to bind them together creating an abstraction between the visualization (the bar chart) and the rest of the application.

These are examples created for a talk ([slides](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/raw/5553051/#0) and [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd2rye9a9kk&feature=share&list=PL3WYihaRBvvs6mYqqEdehX1HiUdu-YPMN)).
